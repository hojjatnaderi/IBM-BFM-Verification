# IBM-BFM-Verification
Here two CFD cases are presented that contain solution to a verification problem. One case uses immeresed boundary method (IBM) and the other case uses body fitted method (BFM) to obtain the results. Cases are developed in foam-extend 4.1, so it is advised to use FE4.1 to run the simulations. Verification problem and data can be found in the reference below.
