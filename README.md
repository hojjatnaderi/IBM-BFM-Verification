# IBM-BFM-Verification
Here two CFD cases are presented that contain solution to a verification problem. One case uses immeresed boundary method (IBM) and the other case uses body fitted method (BFM) to obtain the results. Cases are developed in foam-extend 4.1, so it is advised to use FE4.1 to run the simulations. Verification problem and data can be found in the reference below. The problem consists of the flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number of 100.
